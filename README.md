## Project
This is a single page site for a marriage commissioner based in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The objective of this project is to implement wedding booking functionality and content management system using WordPress.

## Learning Experience
This was a pretty straight forward project. Sections such as About, Services, FAQ and Testimonials are all customizable using Custom Field Suite and Custom Post Types. I used WP Booking Calendar to allow users to book their weddings and Contact Form 7 for sending messages. My biggest challenge for this project was styling the WP Booking Calendar to fit the theme of the site. Other than that, things went smoothly and the client was very happy with how this site turned out.
